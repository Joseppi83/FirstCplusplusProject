# FirstCplusplusProject
My first C++ project with SNHU in CS-210

##Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was a basic 12 and 24 hour clock display that updated the time every one second.

##What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I did well making the code very modular, so that it is easy for one to read and understand the different components of the total project.

##Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by learning how to integrate the code with various displays, such as LED or a modern touch screen GUI, in lieu of just the console.

##Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Yes, as this was the very first project for the course, we only skimmed the surface of C++, before being asked to create this project.  However, using my previous knowledge of JavaScript, Java, and Python, I had an idea of how I could accomplish various points of the grading rubric with those other languages, so I used the C++ documentation and the tutorials at w3schools to gather the information needed to accomplish those goals in C++, translating the process from a previously known language to the mostly unknown language of C++.

##What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Writing code that is decoupled and reusable was a transferable skill to other projects.

##How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project is very decoupled, therefore other components, which will also be decoupled, could greatly enhance the functionality of scope of the foundation created with this first project.
